From the above information we see:

1. Vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance are more likely to provide non-random amounts of variance in this model.

2. The P-Value of 6.712e-11 is smaller than the 0.05% significance level. This shows that this null hypothesis should be rejected, showing that the slope of this linear model is not 0.

3. Based on the r-squared value, this model predicts about 71% of mpg predictions. This means it may not be able to predict the MechaCar prototypes mpg efficiently.
